	<h1>Chapter One</h1>
	<p>HTML uses tags to identify page content.
		<em>This text, for example, is a <strong>paragraph</strong>.</em> Also you can use
		<em>emphasize</em> to make words appear italicized in a paragraph and you can use
		<strong>strong</strong> to make words appear in bold.</p>
	<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
	<h3>Page content</h3>
	<p>The main page content appears inside the
		<b>body</b> tag. HTML contains several elements that allow you to properly structure and format your content, which we'll cover later.</p>
	<h3>Doctype</h3>
	<p>the doc type is suppose to define what type of html you are using. In reality it triggers quirks mode, which ensures your page is going to render properly. you need to have a doctype declaration.
	</p>
	<h3>The document head</h3>
	<p>The <strong>head</strong> is where you put information about the page, links to external scrpits and styles. Before you add the
		<strong>head</strong> you add the <strong>html</strong> tag. The <strong>meta</strong> tag only needs an opening tag. The
		<em>charset</em> can be set to a standered <em>utf</em>. You always want to set the character encoding unless you are a russian alphabet or japaness characters. You can also set a
		<strong>meta</strong> tag to have a <em>name</em> attrabute which can provide a <em>description</em> of the page. Having a title is essential. It not only makes it look professional but it also prevents your page from showing up as an untitled document
		in search results.</p>
	<h3>The document body</h3>
	<p>The <strong>body</strong> is where all your visable content is going to go. You can use an <strong>h1</strong> tag to make a top level heading. There are six
		<strong>h</strong> tags,
		<h1>one</h1> being the biggest or more important and
		<h6>six</h6> being the smallest or least important. Type in the main page content appears inside the body tag. HTML contains several elements that allow you to properly structure and format your content which we'll cover later. Using a
		<strong>paragraph</strong> tag makes the content a paragraph.</p>
	<h3>Understanding content models</h3>
	<p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements.
		<strong>Block level</strong> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while
		<strong>inline level</strong> elements typically appear within the flow of text content.</p>
	<p>In this example the <strong>heading 1</strong> and the <strong>paragraphs</strong> are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
	<p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models:
		<strong>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning</strong>. To learn more about them, visit the
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#kinds-of-content">interactive graphic</a> contained in the W3C HTML5 specfication.</p>
	<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
	<h3>Formatting content with html</h3>
	<pre>Using the <strong>preformatted</strong> tag <em>changes the  format of the text</em> as seen here.</pre>
	<h3>Using headings</h3>
	<p>The <strong>heading</strong> tag is used to make the level of importance of the heading and can  be edited in CSS when you need to adust the font size. They help define the structure of the page. There are several competing theories on exact strategy to use when choosing headings, you should use them in an intelligent manner to accuretly show the importance of each heading or subheading. The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the basic formatting tags and is used very often. You can also use linebreaks (&lang;br&rang;) within headings and paragraphs. </p>
	<p><strong>Headings</strong> should not be used to make the text bigger or smaller. You should use <strong>headings</strong> logically, and if having two <strong>heading ones</strong> of equal improtance you can have them both as a <strong>heading one</strong>.</p>
	<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
	<p> This is the basic formatting in html. If veiwed in a browser unformatted paragraphs will be veiwed as a paragraph. You always want to check and make sure your page is formatted correctly. The paragraph tag needs to be used in every paragraph. All html has margines inbetween paragraph. Css handles things like formatting margines. If using a paragraph with a blank space then you do not need it. </p>
